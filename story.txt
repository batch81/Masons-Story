A long time ago there was once a young boy named Mason who had magical powers.
His parents tried to hide his abilities from the world, but one day things
went bad. He was walking the streets and as he crossed the great bridge connecting
his village to the forest he became frozen. 

Out of nowhere swooped in an evil witch on a broom. She cackled an evil laugh and 
snatch Mason and flew away. Nobody had seen what had happened. Nobody was there to help.
Only Mason's magical powers could save him now.
