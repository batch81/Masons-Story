A long time ago there was once a young boy named Mason who had magical powers.
His parents tried to hide his abilities from the world, but one day things
went bad. He was walking the streets and as he crossed the great bridge connecting
his village to the forest he became frozen. 

Out of nowhere swooped in an evil witch on a broom. She cackled an evil laugh and 
snatch Mason and flew away. Nobody had seen what had happened. Nobody was there to help.
Only Mason's magical powers could save him now. 

Since Mason doesn't ever uses his powers, he felt helpless. After struggling to get 
away from the witch, Mason's hungry and tired and wanted to give up. Right as he was 
about to give up, he felt his powers oozing out of his body. He breaks away from the
from the witch and freezes her as he finally gets to return to his parents with the 
witch's broom.
