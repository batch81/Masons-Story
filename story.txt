A long time ago there was once a young boy named Mason who had magical powers.
His parents tried to hide his abilities from the world, but one day things
went bad. He was walking the streets and as he crossed the great bridge connecting
his village to the forest he became frozen. 

Out of nowhere swooped in an evil witch on a broom. She cackled an evil laugh, 
snatched Mason and flew away. Nobody saw what had happened. Nobody was there to help.
Only Mason's magical powers could save him now. 

Since Mason diddn't ever uses his powers, he felt helpless. After struggling to get 
away from the witch, Mason was hungry, tired and wanted to give up. Right as he was 
about to give up, he felt his powers oozing out of his body. He broke away from the
from the witch and froze her as he finally gets to return to his parents with the 
witch's broom. 

His luck was unbelievable. Mason saved the world from a demon and was able to go back
and live with his parents. Unforunately, this great story was lost for many many centuries.
Some people said it was an urban myth or legend. However, the people that use GitHub know 
the truth. Without this man, we would cease to exsist.
